# Retirement Planning Calculator ðŸ§®

This is a Streamlit-based retirement planning app that calculates how much money is needed at age 55 to fund retirement through four distinct phases:

1. **Phase 1: Early Retirement (up to 62)** â€“ Spending increases annually with inflation.
2. **Phase 2: Go-go (62â€“70)** â€“ Social Security begins; spending continues with inflation.
3. **Phase 3: Slo-go (71â€“80)** â€“ Spending declines gradually.
4. **Phase 4: No-go (80+)** â€“ Spending declines more significantly.

The calculator accounts for:
- Inflation-adjusted spending
- Varying rates of return
- Social Security growth
- Dynamic withdrawal modeling by phase
- Net cash needs and present value discounting

### ðŸ’¡ Inspiration

This project was inspired by [this fantastic retirement planning video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwsUj8MgLWY) by Erin Talks Money. Her breakdown of retirement phases and withdrawal strategies gave me the idea to build this calculator.  It's not EXACTLY like she has laid out the phases in the video but it's close.
